# Contributing

We are happy to receive not only requests, but also contributions. 😆
If you want to contribute, but you have no idea what to add; take a look at the issues opened
and ask in the thread of that issue if you may contribute within that issue. Better to start
with issues marked as `good first issue` and/or `help wanted`.

When contributing try to follow the ideas already in the sourcecode; but this rule is not written in
stone. Nevertheless, it will require a proper discussion to change the way things are done until now. If you feel
a deep change is worth it, try to make your point accross and it will be considered. The recommendation
is still to have an understanding on the project before trying to refactor the whole thing. 🧑‍🔧

Every change should be done through a **PR** describing what the change actually is, accompanied
by tests. This project executes mutation testing, and we will like to maintain **mutation coverage**
beyond *85%* at all time; hence the importance of testing all possible options.
