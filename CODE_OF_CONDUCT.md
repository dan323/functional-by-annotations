# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This project is centered 
on functional programming, mathematics, and software engineering.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
and professional technical community.

## Our Standards

This is a technical project focused on code and mathematics. We value:

* **Technical merit**: Discussions and contributions based on technical quality, correctness, and clarity
* **Constructive feedback**: Respectful code reviews and technical critiques
* **Professionalism**: Treating all participants with courtesy and respect
* **Learning**: Helping others understand functional programming concepts and mathematical foundations
* **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for mistakes in code or documentation and fixing them

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment of any kind**: No tolerance for harassment, intimidation, or threatening behavior
* **Personal attacks**: Focus on the code and ideas, not the person
* **Trolling or disruptive behavior**: Stay on topic and contribute constructively
* **Privacy violations**: Do not share others' private information without permission
* **Off-topic discussions**: Keep discussions focused on the technical aspects of the project
* **Political advocacy**: This is not the place for political discussions or activism
