## CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]
- Future notes.
### Features
- FiniteList: Remove `fromJavaList()` method to simplify API and encourage use of `of()` factory method.

## [1.2] - 2026-06-14
### Features
- Parser: `sepBy()` - Parse separated values with optional separator
- Parser: `optional()` - Parse optionally, returns `Optional<A>`
- FiniteList: Implement `collector()` for Stream integration using ArrayList as mutable intermediate
- FiniteList: Add `fromJavaList()` static method to convert java.util.List to FiniteList
### Fixes
- FiniteListFunctional: `traverse()` implementation fixed to correctly handle empty lists and accumulate results
### Docs
- Documentation: add `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/BUILDING.md`.
- Documentation: expand `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contributor workflow.
- Documentation: add `docs/PARSER.md` with parser combinators guide

## [1.1] - 2026-02-13
### Contents
- Functors on any class. Example: ``FList implements IFunctor<List<?>>``
- Finite lists, repeating list and functions generated by an element and a unitary operator
- Binary tree
- Functions with fixed input type
- Java List and Java Optional as Functors
- Semigroup
- Monoid
- Foldable functional
- Traversal functional
- Alternative functional
- State functional as monad
- Stack data based on State
- Ring algebraic (no tests yet)
- Structured docs
- Lists (reverse only for finite lists)
- Compiler minimum implementation requirements and generated functions
- Methods can be static or instance
- Superclass methods can implement Structures on subclasses
- Structures aware of their type constructor class
- Package renaming and reorganization
- Java 24
- Tests for ListZipper, Maybe, Either, Functions, BinaryTree and Continuation functors
- Test coverage work

Note: Version 1.0 was never released.
